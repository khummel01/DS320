For the past twenty-five years or so, most American schools taught the Civil Rights Movement as an unparalleled success, but in the 21st century, more and more people are asking why there is racial violence and economic inequality if the Civil Rights Movement accomplished what the high school textbooks say it did.  In this class, we will examine the legal, political, economic, and social reforms that the activists of the Civil Rights Movement demanded, along with the pervasive backlash that limited their successes.  We will use the scholarship from history and Africana Studies to investigate these questions, in addition to a range of primary sources including speeches, music, film, television, memoirs, oral histories, and photography.

Then it will be structured around what are seen in anthropology as the key environmental questions arising from increased interaction and unequal exchange among widely different cultures: population growth, economic development and underdevelopment, the loss of biodiversity, environmental management, the future of indigenous peoples, environmental campaigns and collaborations within the context of the politics of natural resources, and the connections between consumption and globalization.\",\n",

The case studies will focus on undocumented migration between Latin America and the United States. From theory, we will move to practice by doing field visits to locations such as the Decorah Community Free Clinic, the Northeast Iowa Peace and Justice Center, and the town of Postville, IA, to learn about the local grassroots and civil society efforts of inclusion of migrants in our immediate community.',\n",

We will discover how medical knowledge and practices are constructed culturally.

       "  \"Consumerism and Sustainability: An Anthropological Perspective. The world is in the midst of unprecedented social and cultural changes. One important dimension of this global change is the dramatic increase in the consumption of goods manufactured, designed and/or marketed by corporations based mainly in Europe and North America. The consumption of 'northern'goods of all kinds threatens the stability and diversity of the natural environment in many ways. Some also argue that, at the local level, consumption constitutes the greatest contemporary threat to the continued existence of local traditions, local cultures and local economic autonomy. In this course, we will pay special attention to some of the linkages between consumer culture and environmental problems, tracing the chains of cause and effect that connect particular kinds of consumption to specific places, resources, people, and interests.

Less well-known but equally wonderful are the comic tales of sex in trees and greedy friars dividing a fart.  We will read Beowulf, narrative poems about love and adventure by Marie de France, the tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and much more, with in-depth attention to Chaucer's Canterbury Tale.

We will focus on the global intersections of contemporary societies and cultures, and the gendered dynamics therein.
